# Luna-AI-Assistent
This project is a voice-controlled digital assistant, built using Python and various modules such as pyttsx3, speech_recognition, wikipedia, and wolframalpha.
The project uses natural language processing (NLP) to recognize spoken commands and perform various tasks such as opening websites, sending emails, playing music, and answering general knowledge questions.
The assistant greets the user and responds to various commands, making it a useful and interactive tool for hands-free tasks.
I am planning to make it into a web application.
